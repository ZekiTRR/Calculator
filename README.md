# Calculator on Java

A simple console-based calculator developed in Java. The current version operates in the console, but there are plans to upgrade it to a windowed interface in the future.

## Project Overview

This calculator supports the following arithmetic operations:

- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`*`)
- **Division** (`/`)
- **Exponentiation** (`**`)
- **Square Root Calculation** (`//`)

The application is designed to be user-friendly, enabling everyday users to perform calculations with ease.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Java

Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or from alternatives like [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZekiTRR/Calculator.git
```


### 3. Compile the Project

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

Compile the Java source code using:

```bash
javac Calculator.java
```

### 4. Run the Project

After successful compilation, launch the application with:

```bash
java Calculator
```


## Future Enhancements

- Transition to a graphical (windowed) interface for an improved user experience.
- Expand the calculator's functionality with additional features.
- Enhance error handling and provide interactive user guidance.
